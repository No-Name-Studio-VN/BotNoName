## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with a local development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/No-Name-Studio-VN/BotNoName
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd BotNoName
   ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**

   ```sh

   ```

4. **Configure your environment:**
   - Create `.env` files based on the provided sample files.
   - Fill in all the required keys and settings.

### Running in Development Mode

- In your `.env` file, set `NODE_ENV` to `development`.
- Ensure you have a Redis instance running.
- Start the bot with the following command:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

### Deploying for Production

> **Note:** For production, the front-end's static files are intended to be deployed on a Content Delivery Network (CDN). You will need to create a separate folder for these files and specify its path in your `.env` file.

1. **Set the environment:**
   - In your `.env` file, change `NODE_ENV` to `production`.
2. **Start your Redis instance:**

   ```sh
   sudo service redis-server start
   # or
   redis-server
   ```

3. **Build the dashboard files:**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start the bot:**
   - We recommend using a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to keep the bot running smoothly.

**Disclaimer on Self-Hosting:** The self-hosting option is primarily intended for those who wish to contribute to the project's development. Creating a personalized instance will require significant modifications, which we do not recommend or support. While we don't prohibit running your own instance, please refrain from claiming the bot as your own work.
